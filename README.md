# DockerChannel

DockerChannel is a Python framework that allows to test covert channels among containers.

In particular, it contains 5 main covert channels that exploit different resources "poorly" isolated when deploying containers via Docker, i.e., the free memory, the CPU load, the number of processes, the number of TCP sockets, and the number of inodes.
DockerChannel allows to use and evaluate the already implemented channels, as well as create new channels.

This repository represents an outcome of a joint research by [CNR-IMATI](https://imati.cnr.it) and [CNR-IEIIT](https://www.ieiit.cnr.it).
In case of exploitation for research purposes, please mention the following research paper.

abstract = {DockerChannel is a software suite for investigating possible information leakages of Docker containers. Its main scope is to support developers to fully assess the impact of the “loose” isolation of statistics provided by the container engine. It can also help researchers to investigate new attacks leveraging the orchestration of malicious containers. DockerChannel is built around an extensible Python class abstracting the creation of the covert communication mechanism and it can be used both in a general-purpose manner or “bundled” within pre-existing containers, e.g., to check leakages in real cloud-native deployments.}

### Installation ###

* Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/cybersecurity-cnr/DockerChannel
```
* `cd` into the cloned repository source files:
```
cd DockerChannel/src
```
* Build the Docker image:
```
docker build -t dockerchannel .
```
* Optionally, save the Docker image to file:
```
docker save dockerchannel:latest|gzip > dockerchannel.tar.gz
```

### Usage ###

Although a Docker execution is suggested, it is possible to run the program also manually.
For the Docker case, some environment variables have to be configured.
Instead, for the manual case, all variables can be provided in input to the program as arguments.
In both the cases, it is needed to run two separate instances of the program: one for the sender, one for the receiver.

#### Execution through Docker ####

In this case, the following environment variables can be used.

**Sockstat**

In this case, the `allocation_amount` and `threshold` variables are expressed in terms of the number of bind [sockets created](https://sleeplessbeastie.eu/2019/08/07/how-to-count-tcp-connections/) at each round.
For further information, please refer to the scientific paper mentioned above.

#### Manual execution by command line ####

It is also possible to launch the following command to get information on the syntax to use for executing DockerChannel via CLI.
Required parameters and their reference is similar (although not exactly the same; see, i.e., the `adjust_timeout_allocation` parameter) to the one reported in the table above for the Docker case.
```
python3 CovertChannel.py -h
```

### Implementation of a new channel ###

Choose a `<filename>` for the Python file to create.
Hence, create a file `<filename>.py` under the `channels` folder.

A starting point to implement the new channel is given by the following code snippet.
```
# importing custom libraries
import utils

# importing standard libraries, if needed

# implementing the channel: do not change class and methods definitions
class CovertChannelType(utils.CovertChannelTypeTemplate):
	# used by the receiver: specify which resource type is this one: NORMAL, REVERSE, ALWAYSINCREASING
	resource_type = utils.ResourceType.NORMAL
	# used by the sender: given an input bit `bit_to_transmit` and an input `allocation_amount` related to a specific configuration for the current channel, allocates the channel for `period` seconds
	def allocate_channel(bit_to_transmit, allocation_amount, period):
		# TODO implement
		pass # does not return anything
	# used by the receiver: returns channel information/bit, given the current receiver configuration file `config`
	def get_channel_resource(config):
		# TODO implement
		return 0 # return either 0 or 1
```
For real samples, see the files under the `channels` folder.

In case the installation of specific libraries is required, properly update the `requirements.txt` file.

If you intend to implement a new channel, open a merge request to include it in this repository and you to the contributors list.
